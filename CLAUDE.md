## Development Commands
(Add common commands here as they're discovered)

## Context
Agentic Counsel is a agent enabled executive coach. Multiple coaching frameworks and personalization frameworks will be used to test effective use of agents for helping users achieve their goals. The initial version uses an astrology profile as a personality profile so that the agent can tailor communication, like a hypothesis test for the user's personality and communication style. Over time, the chat interactions will display behavioural and language preferences. A Memory Bank is established to help maintain preferences over time so that the agent does not need to be retrained in each session with a user.
